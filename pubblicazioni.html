                    <p class="mb-0">Monitoring of long-term contaminant concentrations trends is essential to verify that attenuation processes are effectively occurring at a site. However, monitoring data are often affected by extreme variability which prevents the identification of clear concentration trends. The variability is higher in long-screened monitoring wells, which are currently used at many contaminated sites, although it has been known since the 1980s that monitoring data from long-screened wells can be biased. Understanding the factors that may influence the variability of monitoring data is pivotal. To this end, following hydrochemical conceptual modelling using a multi-method approach, the variability of hydrocarbon concentrations from fully screened monitoring wells was assessed over eleven years at a former oil refinery located in Northern Italy. The proposed methodology combined factor analysis with multiple linear regression models. Results pointed out a higher variability in hydrocarbon concentrations at the plume fringe and a lower variability at the plume source and core. 44–46 % of the total variability in measured hydrocarbon concentrations is due to “intrinsic plume heterogeneity”, related to the three-dimensional structure of a contaminant plume, which becomes thinner at the edge, creating a vertical heterogeneity of redox conditions at the plume fringe. This variability, expressed as increasing concentrations of sulfate and decreasing concentrations of methane, represents a background variability that cannot be reduced by improving sampling procedures. The remaining 56–54 % of the total variability may be due to the non-standardization of some purging and sampling operations, such as pump intake position, purging and sampling time/flow rates and variations in the analytical methods. This finding suggests that monitoring improvements in fully screened wells by standardizing all purging/sampling operations or using sampling techniques that can reduce the actual screen length (e.g., packers or separation/dual pumping techniques) would reduce data variability by more than half.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Groundwater is facing shortage scenarios worldwide due to a changing climate, but systems governed by different recharge processes may react differently. Hence, understanding groundwater budget components is critical for sustainable resource management. This study analyzes seasonal groundwater level patterns from ca. 60 wells, investigating different hydrogeological contexts and water management practices. In the first phase, data under baseline conditions (2013–2021) are analyzed to identify the average seasonal patterns and the associated recharge and discharge processes. Successively, the 2022 data is compared with baseline data to quantify the effect of the hydrological drought. Results show that in surface-water-fed irrigation areas, the absence of surface water during the 2022 summer, related to winter snow scarcity in the Alps, caused significant disruption of the typical groundwater seasonal profile. The winter groundwater table decrease was more than twice the average decrease under baseline conditions, and the summer rise was the 30% of the average rise under baseline conditions. This is related to the missing recharge and the increased abstraction of groundwater to fill the lack of surface water for irrigation needs. Therefore, in a scenario of dryer summers linked to climate change, the plausible transition toward more efficient irrigation methods or groundwater irrigation could cause severe groundwater depletion and compensation measures will be needed. Conversely, in groundwater-fed irrigation areas, the increased irrigation needs during the 2022 summer determined a summer groundwater depletion 76% wider than the average summer depletion under baseline conditions. Here, mitigation actions to reduce abstracted volumes, such as transitioning to more efficient irrigation systems, could reduce groundwater vulnerability to climate change. On the other hand, aquifer systems governed by natural recharge and discharge processes showed a wider pluriannual variability associated with dry and wet years and resulted less vulnerable to single dry seasons than highly anthropic systems.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">The increasing rate of urbanisation and extreme climatic events represent a constant threat for urban water resources management. In recent decades, Milan Metropolitan Area (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) has been affected by a) frequent extreme rainfall events, responsible for the flooding of major surface water courses, and b) groundwater management problems, both from a quantitative (i.e. interaction with underground infrastructures) and qualitative point of view. Moreover, the increasing use of groundwater geothermal systems also requires further considerations. This work analyses the literature available in the area regarding surface floods, groundwater quantity, quality, and temperature. Finally, a discussion is provided to understand a) which approaches could promote an effective management of both surface water and groundwater resources b) which points of contact emerge between these two aspects of the urban water cycle, and c) which possible urban interventions could contribute to an integrated and functional management of water resources, also reducing some current issues.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In the last decades, scientific attention has grown toward vulnerability assessment of drinking water quality. Groundwater is a crucial resource for drinking water needs, and its vulnerability to contaminations is associated with natural and anthropic processes. The vulnerability of wells tapping confined aquifers is frequently associated with natural contamination by reduced species (e.g., As), while anthropic contamination is considered less relevant. Nevertheless, mixing processes induced by water pumping and related to the well structure can determine the presence of a shallower water fraction in the extracted water, which increases wells vulnerability to anthropic contamination. In this study, redox zonation is applied to water quality data of 16 drinking water wells tapping confined aquifers to assess the main processes affecting water quality. All the considered wells resulted under reducing conditions at different redox states. Three wells showed evidence of mixing processes between shallower and deeper waters. In these cases, mixing processes lower the concentration of As, but increase the vulnerability toward anthropic contamination.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Acque Bresciane is a public company that manages the integrated water cycle for more than 580,000 inhabitants in the Province of Brescia, in the north of Italy, providing drinking water, waste water treatment, and sewer systems. Drinking water systems are supplied with different types of groundwater, springs, and surface water sources (from lakes and rivers) whose availability and quality can be affected by climate change events. A multidisciplinary team, in collaboration with the University of Milano Bicocca, developed a specific Water Safety Plan (WSP) risk matrix focusing on the evaluation of climate-related hazardous events and calculation of their likelihood of occurrence, also using thematic maps. Moreover, to reduce the residual risks, in the risk matrix, possible control measures are suggested, such as the activation of an emergency plan, the use of other water sources, storage tanks, and interconnection with other water distribution networks. This work shows a simple and effective tool that can be applied by drinking water utilities to evaluate climate-related catchment risks, using a WSP risk matrix, thematic maps, and possible control measures to reduce risks in terms of water quality and availability and to respond with resilience to changes.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Plastic debris is thought to be widespread in freshwater ecosystems globally1. However, a lack of comprehensive and comparable data makes rigorous assessment of its distribution challenging2,3. Here we present a standardized cross-national survey that assesses the abundance and type of plastic debris (>250 μm) in freshwater ecosystems. We sample surface waters of 38 lakes and reservoirs, distributed across gradients of geographical position and limnological attributes, with the aim to identify factors associated with an increased observation of plastics. We find plastic debris in all studied lakes and reservoirs, suggesting that these ecosystems play a key role in the plastic-pollution cycle. Our results indicate that two types of lakes are particularly vulnerable to plastic contamination: lakes and reservoirs in densely populated and urbanized areas and large lakes and reservoirs with elevated deposition areas, long water-retention times and high levels of anthropogenic influence. Plastic concentrations vary widely among lakes; in the most polluted, concentrations reach or even exceed those reported in the subtropical oceanic gyres, marine areas collecting large amounts of debris4. Our findings highlight the importance of including lakes and reservoirs when addressing plastic pollution, in the context of pollution management and for the continued provision of lake ecosystem services.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Freshwater pollution by nitrate is a major threat to human and ecosystem health. Basin-scale studies on nitrate pollution generally focus separately on surface water or on groundwater bodies, thus the role played by their interaction on nitrate concentrations, possibly including also agricultural irrigation, is often overlooked and so is addressed here in the intensively irrigated hydro-system of the Oglio River basin (Northern Italy). Tracers of groundwater recharge (stable water isotopes and Cl/Br ratio) together with nitrate and boron stable isotopes indicate that the main source of the diffuse nitrate pollution affecting groundwater resources in the area is related to agricultural activities and, locally, to untreated civil/industrial effluents. Moreover, these data reveal the strong control of irrigation return flow on groundwater nitrate concentrations, with contrasting effects: groundwater-fed irrigation promotes higher concentrations due to the recirculation of high-NO3 groundwater, whereas intensive surface-water-irrigation, fed by low-NO3 river water, generates lower concentrations due to dilution. The control of irrigation return flow on groundwater nitrate links nitrate pollution and climate change: if surface-water-irrigation will be abandoned, as a consequence of intensified summer droughts, in favor of groundwater-fed irrigation, an increase in groundwater nitrates is expected due to a basin-scale groundwater recirculation and the cessation of the dilution effect. In addition to the reduction of the N input to soils from fertilizers, i.e., the sole pollution mitigation strategy able to solve the problem, an adaptation strategy to climate change might be the implementation, during non-irrigation rainy periods, of managed aquifer recharge operations, such as the so-called “forested infiltration areas”, to take advantage of water abundancy from rivers under high-flow conditions, thus combining a supplement on groundwater recharge with the beneficial dilution effect on dissolved nitrate.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">As groundwater quality monitoring networks have been expanded over the last decades, significant time series are now available. Therefore, a scientific effort is needed to explore innovative techniques for groundwater quality time series exploitation. In this work, time series exploratory analysis and time series cluster analysis are applied to groundwater contamination data with the aim of developing data-driven monitoring strategies. The study area is an urban area characterized by several superimposing historical contamination sources and a complex hydrogeological setting. A multivariate time series cluster analysis was performed on PCE and TCE concentrations data over a 10 years time span. The time series clustering was performed based on the Dynamic Time Warping method. The results of the clustering identified 3 clusters associated with diffuse background contamination and 7 clusters associated with local hotspots, characterized by specific time profiles. Similarly, a univariate time series cluster analysis was applied to Cr(VI) data, identifying 3 background clusters and 7 hotspots, including 4 singletons. The clustering outputs provided the basis for the implementation of data-driven monitoring strategies and early warning systems. For the clusters associated with diffuse background contaminations and those with constant trends, trigger levels were calculated with the 95° percentile, constituting future threshold values for early warnings. For the clusters with pluriannual trends, either oscillatory or monotonous, specific monitoring strategies were proposed based on trends’ directions. Results show that the spatio-temporal overview of the data variability obtained from the time series cluster analysis helped to extract relevant information from the data while neglecting measurements noise and uncertainty, supporting the implementation of a more efficient groundwater quality monitoring.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Urbanization is a worldwide process that recently has culminated in wider use of the subsurface, determining a significant interaction between groundwater and underground infrastructures. This can result in infiltrations, corrosion, and stability issues for the subsurface elements. Numerical models are the most applied tools to manage these situations. Using MODFLOW-USG and combining the use of Wall (HFB) and DRN packages, this study aimed at simulating underground infrastructures (i.e., subway lines and public car parks) and quantifying their infiltrations. This issue has been deeply investigated to evaluate water inrush during tunnel construction, but problems also occur with regard to the operation of tunnels. The methodology has involved developing a steady-state groundwater flow model, calibrated against a maximum groundwater condition, for the western portion of Milan city (Northern Italy, Lombardy Region). Overall findings pointed out that the most impacted areas are sections of subway tunnels already identified as submerged. This spatial coherence with historical information could act both as validation of the model and a step forward, as infiltrations resulting from an interaction with the water table were quantified. The methodology allowed for the improvement of the urban conceptual model and could support the stakeholders in adopting proper measures to manage the interactions between groundwater and the underground infrastructures.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Time-dependent geolocalized analysis of pollution data allows to better understand their dynamics over time and could suggest strategies to restore a good ecological status of contaminated area. This research analyzes concentrations of pollutants in surface waters and groundwater monitored by the Regional Environment Protection Agency of Lombardy from 2017 to 2020. Lombardy is one of the richest and populous region of Europe, providing an interesting example of the impact of environmental pollutants due to anthropogenic and industrial activities, not only for Italy but also for all Europe. Results show that groundwater displays more sites with heavy metals above the legal limit with respect to surface waters, including As, Ni, Cr and Zn. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal analysis of the data clearly shows that the introduction of more restrictive laws is a proper policy to improve the ecological status of the water.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Water abstraction is a key aspect when performing drinking water risk assessment within the scope of Water Safety Plan (WPS). In this context, evaluating aquifer vulnerability could be not exhaustive. Care must be taken to consider the well structure and dynamic behavior that can determine different water quality and vulnerability than those of the tapped aquifer. Here, a methodological approach to assess well vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic pollution is proposed. A data-driven hydrogeochemical conceptual modeling was performed through cluster analysis, supporting the identification of the main features determining well vulnerability. Well vulnerability was then assessed through a semi-quantitative method based on a well-specific analysis of the tapped aquifer type, water table depth, vadose zone permeability, natural redox conditions, and qualitative classification of the tapped groundwater age, considering evidence of mixing processes induced by the well dynamic behavior. Each feature was categorized into several classes, and a score was associated with each class according to the vulnerability induced by that specific condition. The method was applied to a dataset of ∼200 wells, in northern Italy. Each well was classified, and its vulnerability was assessed. The method was validated by analyzing the distribution of wells affected by natural or anthropogenic pollution in each of the vulnerability classes. Results of the chi-square test showed that the distribution of the polluted wells was associated with vulnerability classes, which is evidence of the robustness and reliability of the proposed method. This method was developed exploiting only hydrogeological information and raw water quality data, largely available to water managers from routine monitoring, which makes this approach widely applicable and cost-effective.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">The town of Mantua is a good example of an urban area with an intricate surface water system leading to complex groundwater/surface-water interactions. In this context, the Site of National Interest (SIN) “Laghi di Mantova e Polo Chimico”, is characterized by intense pumping activity by means of industrial wells and hydraulic barriers. In order to establish the interactions between groundwater and the surface water system, evaluating their relation with the pumping activities, a transient groundwater numerical model was developed (January 2016-December 2018) using MODFLOW-2005 and the Streamflow-Routing (SFR2) package, following a participatory approach. Results show how, depending on the minimum/ maximum groundwater conditions and the discharge values of the surface channels, the relation between groundwater/surface-waters can vary during the year, also affecting the operation of the hydraulic barriers. The stakeholders could use the calibrated model in the future to ensure optimal management of the pumping activities within the SIN.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">The significant increase in urbanization has resulted in greater use of the subsurface in urban planning and, therefore, increased interaction between groundwater and underground infrastructure. Numerical models are the primary tool adopted to manage the resulting problems; however, their construction is time- and cost-consuming. Groundwater-level time-series analysis can be a complementary method, as this data-driven approach does not require an extensive understanding of the geological and boundary conditions, even if providing insights into the hydrogeologic behaviour. Thus, a data-driven approach was adopted to analyse groundwater time-series of the shallow aquifer, occupied by several underground structures, beneath Milan city (Northern Italy). Statistical (Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope estimator, autocorrelation and cross-correlation, hierarchical cluster analysis) and geospatial techniques were used to detect the potential variables influencing the groundwater levels of 95 monitoring wells, covering the period 2005–2019. A general rising trend of the water table was identified, with local hydrogeologic differences in the western and southernmost areas. Based on time-series analysis results, four management areas have been identified. These areas could act as future geographic units with specific groundwater management strategies. In particular, subsurface public car parks can be classified with respect to groundwater flooding as (1) not submerged, (2) possibly critical, or (3) submerged at different groundwater conditions. According to these outcomes, targeted guidelines for constructing new car parks have been elaborated for each management area. The methodology proved to be efficient in improving the urban conceptual model and helping stakeholders design the planned underground development, considering groundwater aspects.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Calculating natural background levels (NBLs) in groundwater is vital for supporting a sustainable use of groundwater resources. Although NBLs are often assessed through a unique concentration value per groundwater body, where hydrogeochemical features are highly variable, spatial heterogeneity needs to be accounted for, leading to the calculation of so-called “local” NBLs. Despite much research devoted to the identification of the best performing techniques for local NBLs spatialization, a deep understanding of the link between local NBL values and their generating hydrogeochemical processes is often lacking and so is addressed here for the redox-sensitive species As, NH4, Fe and Mn in the groundwater bodies of Lombardy region, N Italy. Local NBLs were calculated by a tired approach involving the hybridization of preselection and probability plot methods. Since the spatial variability of the target species depends mainly on redox conditions, a redox zonation was performed using multivariate statistical analysis. A conceptual model was developed and improved combing factor and cluster analysis. Results showed that NBLs for arsenic were up to 291 μg/L, reached in groundwaters under methanogenesis, a condition related to the prolonged degradation of peat buried in aquifer sediments. Ammonium NBLs up to 6.62 mg/L were generated by the upwelling of fluids from deep sediments hosting petroleum systems; ammonium NBLs up to 4.48 mg/L were generated as the accumulation of by-products of peat degradation. Iron and manganese NBLs up to, respectively, 6.0 and 1.51 mg/L were generated by the oxidation of younger and less stable Mn and Fe oxides within river valleys, mostly the Po River valley. The evaluation of local NBLs, and their association to generating natural hydrogeochemical processes/conditions, achieves a step forward from the commonly used approach of a single NBL per groundwater body, improving decision-support tools for sustainable groundwater management and protection.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Freshwaters constitute a fundamental and extremely limited resource for atoll islands' population. The interplay of climatic and human-driven processes, which affect both the quantity and the quality of freshwater resources, may exacerbate the problem of water security and availability. This work evaluated the effects of good spectrum of anthropic impacts on groundwater quality in a typical and representative native inhabited island (c.a. 850 people) of Maldives, analyzing and interpreting hydrological and hydrochemical data, collected during a specific field survey on 51 sampling points after a rainy season. The island groundwater is constituted by a thin asymmetric lens, periodically recharged by rain. The lifestyle of people and water exploitation seem to be sustainable, even if groundwater resources are already experiencing moderate contamination and, limited to some areas, heavy pollution. The sources of impacts have been identified in diffuse organic matter contamination due to a poor domestic wastewater treatment, farming (poultry) and gardening activities. To face these impacts, it is essential to build a sewer system paired with a possibility to recycle wastewater reducing water over-exploitation. The collaborative and educational initiatives organization, at different levels, can increase the capacity for planning a sustainable development. Our results provide useful information for sustainable management plans to preserve freshwater resources of the island, which conservation is especially important considering the context of the future lifestyle changes and climatic scenarios for the Maldives. These findings can be extended by analogy to others atoll islands.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Arsenic is found in groundwater above regulatory limits in many countries and its origin is often from natural sources, making the definition of Natural Background Levels (NBLs) crucial. NBL is commonly assessed based on either dedicated small-scale monitoring campaigns or large-scale national/regional groundwater monitoring networks that may not grab local-scale heterogeneities. An alternative method is represented by site-specific monitoring networks in contaminated/polluted sites under remediation. As a main drawback, groundwater quality at these sites is affected by human activities. This paper explores the potential for groundwater data from an assemblage of site-specific datasets of contaminated/polluted sites to define NBLs of arsenic (As) at the meso-scale (order of 1000 km2). Common procedures for the assessment of human influence cannot be applied to this type of dataset due to limited data homogeneity. Thus, an “unorthodox” method is applied involving the definition of a consistent working dataset followed by a statistical identification and critical analysis of the outliers. The study was conducted in a highly anthropized area (Ferrara, N Italy), where As concentrations often exceed national threshold limits in a shallow aquifer. The results show that site-specific datasets, if properly pre-treated, are an effective alternative for the derivation of NBLs when regional monitoring networks fail to catch local-scale variability.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">The recent rapid increase in urbanization has led to the inclusion of underground spaces in urban planning policies. Among the main subsurface resources, a strong interaction between underground infrastructures and groundwater has emerged in many urban areas in the last few decades. Thus, listing the underground infrastructures is necessary to structure an urban conceptual model for groundwater management needs. Starting from a municipal cartography (Open Data), thus making the procedure replicable, a GIS methodology was proposed to gather all the underground infrastructures into an updatable 3D geodatabase (GDB) for the metropolitan city of Milan (Northern Italy). The underground volumes occupied by three categories of infrastructures were included in the GDB: (a) private car parks, (b) public car parks and (c) subway lines and stations. The application of the GDB allowed estimating the volumes lying below groundwater table in four periods, detected as groundwater minimums or maximums from the piezometric trend reconstructions. Due to groundwater rising or local hydrogeological conditions, the shallowest, non-waterproofed underground infrastructures were flooded in some periods considered. This was evaluated in a specific pilot area and qualitatively confirmed by local press and photographic documentation reviews. The methodology emerged as efficient for urban planning, particularly for urban conceptual models and groundwater management plans definition.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">The EU Water Framework Directive requires Member States to assess the quantitative and qualitative status of groundwater bodies and to achieve a good status by 2027. The present study was developed in order to assess the groundwater quantitative status in the Aosta Plain (NW Italy), following the methodology proposed through a guideline defined by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), with the aim of supporting local authorities in their periodic assessment of water bodies status. In the study area, during the period 2000-2017, groundwater levels were measured in 213 wells and piezometers. Performing the four tests required by the abovementioned guideline, the quantitative status was assessed on the basis of multi-year groundwater level variations, water balance and the interconnections of groundwater with surface water bodies and groundwaterdependent ecosystems. A good status was assessed for the study area, although some critical aspects emerged from the application of the guideline methodology: the data collected by the monitoring network are not sufficiently robust in terms of sample size, spatial distribution, temporal interval and frequency to fulfill the requirements of the guideline methodology. Therefore, some recommendations to improve the data quality and better address the future assessment of groundwater quantitative status were given.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Recent studies have highlighted an increase of chloride in many lakes worldwide, with negative effects on chemical and physical properties of inland waters and freshwater biota. In this study, we assessed the long-term trend (1993–2017) of chloride in Lake Iseo, located in the midlatitudes, and analyzed its relationship with discharge data of the inflows and hydrological and hydroclimatic changes. Additionally, we performed a specific annual survey, collecting water samples at a biweekly frequency in tributaries, calculating chloride load, and comparing the result with the chloride increase observed in lacustrine water. The combined use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and multivariate analyses allowed identification of possible sources of chloride and their seasonal dynamic within the mixed-land-use watershed: impervious surface and deicing salt, population and sewage effluents, livestock, and rainwater. Their potential contribution to total mass balance was assessed, cross-checking the results between chloride source evaluation and load estimation. Chloride load from wastewater treatment plants played an important role, albeit we highlighted that the main source was the road deicing salt, with a primarily winter contribution. The increased anthropization in the watershed was likely the main cause of the chloride enhancement. This study demonstrates that the problem of salinization can also affect lakes located in the midlatitude areas and provides a reproducible method for the identification and quantification of the different sources. Our results will help to better understand the potential sources of salinity in rivers that may reveal processes controlling the salinization of freshwater systems, with implications for future management practices.</p>

Hydrogeological sections, piezometric maps, spatio-temporal and multivariate analysis of hydrochemical data enabled to define a conceptual model and to build a groundwater flow model, solved and calibrated by means of MODFLOW-NWT and PEST. The results of the study pointed out that the leachate overflow produced an impulsive contamination, currently in attenuation, which behaved differently in areas with different redox characteristics.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In this study, sources of groundwater pollution in a landfill site were identified, using artificial sweeteners as chemical tracers, multivariate statistical analysis and a quantitative analysis of the groundwater flow system through particle tracking and transport modeling. The study area, located in northern Italy, hosts an older unlined landfill and a newer lined municipal solid waste landfill placed downstream of the former. Groundwater, surface water, treated wastewater, and leachate samples were collected in March 2017 for analysis of the artificial sweeteners saccharin, cyclamate, acesulfame and sucralose together with major cations and anions, inorganic nitrogen compounds, total phosphorus, COD and some further parameters. The interpretation of the results suggests that two main leachate leaks/spills are affecting the study area. The first one concerns leachate probably spilling out of the leachate collection system serving the younger lined landfill, the other one involves leachate from the older unlined landfill that also seems to affect an area downstream of the lined landfill. Direct leachate leaks from the lined landfill seem unlikely, although they cannot be definitively excluded. This work underlines the importance of a multi-methods approach, which integrates here chemical tracers, multivariate analysis and transport modeling, for assessing groundwater pollution sources generated from complex landfill sites, where multiple and different sources may exist. In particular, this work highlights how artificial sweeteners can be used for tracing leachate plumes from landfills. The methodology applied in this study can have a broad applicability also in other polluted landfill sites worldwide.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Groundwater level forecasting is a useful tool for a more efficient and sustainable groundwater resource management. Developing models that can accurately reproduce groundwater level response to meteorological conditions can lead to a better understanding of the groundwater resource availability. Here an autoregressive neural network (NNARx) approach is proposed and compared with autoregressive linear models with exogenous input (ARx) in order to forecast groundwater level in an aquifer system where a linear groundwater level response to recharge by rainfall is observed. A well known problem regarding neural networks consists in the high risk of overfitting. Here, three NNARx model were trained using different methods to avoid overfitting: Early stopping, Bayesian regularization and a combination of both. The results show that on the short term forecasting (up to 15 days) the performance of NNARx and ARx are comparable but the ARx model generalizes better, while the NNARx trained with Bayesian regularization outperforms the linear models and the other NNARx models on longer scenarios on the test set. As linear models are less time demanding and do not require high computational power, they can be considered as suitable tools for short term groundwater level forecasting in linear systems while when longer scenarios are needed neural networks can be considered more reliable, and training them with Bayesian regularization allows to minimize the risk of overfitting.</p>
